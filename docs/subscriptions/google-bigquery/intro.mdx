# Getting Started

In this section, we will see how to set up a pipeline using Bitquery real-time GraphQL subscriptions.

We will use a subscription query, integrate Google Pub/Sub, create subscribers, and then set up a BigQuery table to receive data from one of those Pub/Sub subscribers.

This is just a sample setupâ€”you can use any intermediary to feed data into Google BigQuery or any other cloud database.

## Architecture

- Pub/Sub acts as a messaging intermediary, allowing your Bitquery data pipeline to be independent of downstream consumers.

- You can later process or store the data in different systems (e.g., BigQuery, Cloud Functions) without modifying the Bitquery integration.

## Prerequisities

- Enable billing on your Google Cloud Account ( Free-tier allowed), needed for APIs
- Setup Access for Service Accounts to access Pub-Sub Subscription and Google Bigquery Table

### Scalability

- Pub/Sub scales automatically, ensuring that your system can handle spikes in Bitquery traffic without worrying about overloading downstream systems.

### Reliability

Pub/Sub guarantees delivery "at least once," so you don't lose data even if there are temporary processing failures.

### Flexibility

Pub/Sub supports multiple subscribers for the same topic, so you can fan out data to different systems (e.g., analytics, monitoring, alerts).
