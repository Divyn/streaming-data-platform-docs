# Solana Builder Terms Explaination

### Dataset Parameters

Solana API allows you to narrow down your results using these parameters:

- `archive`: Archive dataset contains the data from the first (genesis) block up until the realtime dataset(not including).
- `realtime`: Realtime dataset containing last set of blocks. Eg. only few hours recent data
- `combined`: Combined dataset ( realtime and archive ).

### Filter Parameters

Solana API allows you to narrow down your results using these parameters:

- `limit`: Limit the results to a specified number.
- `limitBy`: Limit results based on a specific field's value.
- `orderBy`: Order results according to a field's value.
- `where`: Filter results based on specific criteria related to the value of the returned field.

### BalanceUpdate API Terms

- `Account`: The specific Solana account that the balance update pertains to.
- `Amount`: The quantity of tokens that were added to or subtracted from the account.
- `AmountInUSD`: AmountInUSD will always be calculated based on the USD value of an asset pulled from centralized exchanges. If it is 0, it means we don't have a USD value. In such cases, you can use counterparty AmountInUSD. For example, if token A is traded against WSOL, and we are showing 0 for token A's AmountInUSD, it means we don't have token A's USD value, but you can use the AmountInUSD of WSOL.
- `Currency`: The type of token or cryptocurrency involved in the balance update.
- `PostBalance`: The account's balance after the update has been applied.
- `PostBalanceInUSD`: The equivalent value of the PostBalance in US dollars at the time of the transaction.
- `PreBalance`: The account's balance before the update was applied.
- `PreBalanceInUSD`: The equivalent value of the PreBalance in US dollars at the time of the transaction.

### Block API Terms

- `Hash`: A unique identifier generated from the block's data, ensuring data integrity and security.
- `Height`: The position of a block in the blockchain, indicating its order relative to other blocks.
- `ParentHash`: The unique identifier (hash) of the preceding block in the blockchain, linking the current block to its parent.
- `ParentSlot`: The slot number of the block that precedes the current block, used to maintain the order of blocks.
- `RewardsCount`: The number of rewards transactions included in a block, often related to staking or validation rewards.
- `Slot`: A specific time interval in which a block is proposed and validated on the Solana network.
- `Time`: The precise timestamp when the block was created, recorded in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
