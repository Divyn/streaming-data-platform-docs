# Overview

Bitquery APIs provide access to real-time and historical data from the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based blockchains through its EVM-based schema. The schema is designed to enable developers to query blockchain data through an API using GraphQL.

The EVM-based schema contains different types of queries, such as block, transaction, event, miner rewards, and token transfers. These queries can be used to retrieve different types of blockchain data, such as block information, transaction details, events, and token transfers.

Here's a list of different sections in this documentation:

 1. [Blocks](/docs/schema/evm/blocks)
 2.  [Miner Rewards](/docs/schema/evm/miners)
 3.  [Uncle Blocks](/docs/schema/evm/uncles)
 4.  [Balances](/docs/schema/evm/balances)
 5.  [Transfers](/docs/schema/evm/transfers)
 6.  [Transactions](/docs/schema/evm/transactions)
 7. [Events](/docs/schema/evm/events)
 8. [Dex Trades](/docs/schema/evm/dextrades)
 9. [Calls](/docs/schema/evm/calls)
